                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 20px;line-height: 22px;margin:15px">Overlooking the shores of the Bay of Bengal, the Shore Temple complex was the site of a busy port during the early years of empire. Built using blocks of granite, there are three temples that are spread across the vast area. The main temple, a tribute to Lord Shiva, faces the east so that sun rays shine upon the Shiva Linga, located in the garbhagriha. Of the other two shrines leftover, one is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and another to Lord Shiva. Lord Vishnu's complex sits in between both Shiva complexes as a symbol of balance. The temple walls are elaborately embellished with large sculptures of Nandi and a series of rearing lions. 
                        Legends say that Marco Polo and other European merchants called the site, Seven Pagodas. Acting as a landmarks for ships, the name became widespread among merchants. It is believed that Shore Temple along with six other pagoda shaped monuments once stood across the shore of the Bay of Bengal.
